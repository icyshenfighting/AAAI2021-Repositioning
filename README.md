# Collaborative Mutil-agent planning of autonomous taxis: A Case Study in New York Manhattan island


 Hello, everyone, welcome to the "New York autonomous taxi intelligent planning" projects.
 
 
 The data used in this research were collected from taxi data-sets in Manhattan island, New York from November 1st-7st, 2019 on Yellow Cab's website https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.

To obtain the performance of our planning framework and comparisons with other policies, a Monte Carlo simulation is introduced in this paper. In the simulation phase, 3000 autonomous taxis are randomly generated in the network on 00:00 am per day, and there are two baseline heuristics compared with our system:
